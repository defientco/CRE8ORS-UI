        The world, once vibrant, has faded into shades of grey. <br />
        Drained of color by control, greed, and power. <br />
        Individuality has become a monochrome echo of what it once was. <br />
        <br />
        But we’re still here, and we stand different. <br />
        We are the color in this world gone black and white. <br />
        We are the creative spark, reigniting passion and purpose. <br />
        We are the rebels, the degenerates, and the misfits. <br />
        The connectors, the inventors, and the innovators.
        <br />
        We steer the ship of current culture. <br />
        <br />
        Cre8ors are inclusive. We speak to people from all walks of life. <br />
        Cre8ors are mindful. We care about and respect people’s feelings. <br />
        Cre8ors are transparent. We condemn any shadiness or ulterior motives.
        <br />
        Cre8ors are accountable. We fuck up and take responsibility for it. <br />
        Cre8ors are advocates. We support each others mental health.
        <br />
        Cre8ors are fearless. We are not afraid to speak our minds. <br />
        Cre8ors have empathy. We will walk a mile in any shoe.
        <br />
        Together, we will band together... <br />
        And restore the hues of creativity, <br />
        To bring color back to web3. <br />
        In a world filled with kaleidoscopic possibilities, <br />
        Will you choose to stay in the black and white? <br />
        Or join us and break free... <br />
